# iOS Ecommerce App

This is a basic Ecommerce app which allows you to log in into a server, add and remove products to cart and check that cart.
It has been made as an academic project, and I focused myself in developing the evaluated functionalities. For this reason, the app is lacking some really useful functionalities like an administration panel according to the user role, or an user profile side.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
You will need CocoaPods, Moltin, Alamofire and SwiftyJSON.

### Prerequisites

To install the project you will need to have the lastest version of Xcode. If you don't have it yet you can download it in the App Store.

### Installing

Download the project folder or clone the repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/FCartier/iOS-Ecommerce-app.git
```

Then open the project folder and double click on the Loic&Flo.xcworkspace

The project is open in your Xcode :)

## Built With

* [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) - Used to interact with the server
* [SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON) - Used to deal easily with the JSON data
